while the newly introduced procedure of the inquisition,
soon developiug into the possessory and petitory actious
oi real property law, and at the same time revealing the
very features of the jury system, advances steadily to
commanding influence aud to permanent place. Beside
theold purely verbal procedure, the Norman procedure
by writ has talreu firm root, aud forms of action begin
to appear, though ae yet failing to give promise of the
subtleties and conflicts ot their later stage.

All the forms of procf iu use among the Anglo·
Saxona—by ordeal‚ cath (compurgation, afterwards
called wager of law), witnesscs and clrartcrs,-continued
throughout the Norman and sub-Norman period.

'Phe iudicatione above suggested of the decline within
the period os this book of the ordeal (or judgmeut by hot
irou, hot or cold water, or the morsel, also commonly

called “judicium Dei”) are entirely negative. Nothing
is directly stated in the chronicles or laws of the time to
show the gradual transformation aud decay os the typical
procedure of the Anglo-Saxon period. But the absence
of it in the civil litigation of the later Norman and

Augevin time becomes very marked and suggestive.
In the time of the Conqueror, the evidences of its fre·
quent use in civil as wellas in criminal cases are clear
and convincing,botb among the English and also among
the Normans; though with the latter it had been re-
garded in Normandy with less favour than the duel, as

was still the case in Englaud.¹

and an Englishman‚ inEngland, follows, auao993. But it was not '
a case of judicia] combat; aud it probably occurred in the Danish
district. See Johuston’s Antiquitates Culta-Scaudicre, p. 74

favourito English procedure-is not unworthy os consideration iu
discussing the extent ot* the Gonquorods confiscatione.
