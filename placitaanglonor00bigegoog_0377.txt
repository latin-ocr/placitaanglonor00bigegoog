purge himself “ laicaliter.” Iu a letter sent to the king atter this
interview, the hishop says: “Si adhuc in sententia illa, ut me
purgare debeam laico more perseveratis, de hcc prius paratus sum
recto judicio judicari, eu quidem condicione, ut si quis me in justo
judicio opprimere voluerit, securitate predicte pacis conservata,
liceat mihi contradicere secuudum recta judicia mei ordinis in co
loco ubi canonice judicatum fuerit, et quioquid ibi recte judicabitur,
ex toto profiteor mc sequi, sive carcerali pena cruciari, seu honoris
dignitate privari.” The king replies by seizing the messenger and
sending his army against the hishop. After ravaging the country,
the king’s generals arrange a safc conduct for the bishop through

the lines to the King’s Court3 which was then in attendance upon ,

the king, aiding him in the suppression of the rebellion set on foot
at the beginning of his reign. Theccurt consisted nithe king’s
retinne of great men, archbishop hanfranc, archbishop Thomas, the
hishops, earls, barons, and officere of the amry. After entering the
court, the bishop erices, and, addressing the king, prsys to be re-
stored to the enjoyment of his bishopric, ol which habas been
deprived, as he says, “ sine judicio.” Heia told that he must first
answer the king. This he refuses to do, and claime exemption as

Hugo de Bello-Monte ex precepto regis surgens dixit episcopo,
“ Rex te appellat, quod cum ipse audivit qnod inimici sui super eum
veniebant, et homiues sui, episcopus scilicet Baiocensis,¹ ct chcrus
comes et alii plures regnum suum pariter sibi et coronam auferre
volebant, et ipse per consilium tuum contra illos equitabat: ipse
te, me audiente, summonuit, ut curn eo equitares, tu vero respon·
disti ei, tc cum septem militibus, quos ibi habebas, libenter iturum,
et pro pluribus ud castellum tuum sub festinacione missurum, et
postea fugisti de curia sua sine ejus licentia, et quosdam de familia
sua tecum adduxisti, et ita in necessitate sua defecisti, et modo vult
ut inde sibi iacias quod curia sua judicabit, et si necesse fuerit
postea te pluribus appellavit.'' [The bishop persists iu refusing to
be tried on tte charge until the king first hears his complaint for
the disseisin of his dignities and temporalities. The question is
then taken into consideration on suggestion of the bishop of
Contances whether the king ought first to hear the accused3 the
latter retiring with his retainers until adeeision is made by the
court. A conclusion having hasarsuhal, the hisbcp returns, and
