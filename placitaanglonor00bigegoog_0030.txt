not have full confidence in the witnesses, to require them
to make oath to their return, p. 139.

'Phepromise of Glanvill, as above indicated, disappears
again in the time of Stephen ; though only two writs of
inquisition of this reign are given. 'Phe first orders an
inquiry “ by the vicinage and the good men of the dis-
trict if five acres held by W. In, through a disseisin 01
the plaintiffs, which land they claim, arc os their tenure,'’
p. 160. And the second writ, relating to the lands above·
mentioned 01 the abbot of Gloucester, and directed against
the same party, commands that he justly give seisin 10
the abbot 01 0 certain chnrch, lands aad tithes, “ as he
had been seised on the day when king Henry last crossed
into Normandy‚'’ p. loa. 'Phe quoted part 01 this
second writ deserves to be compared with the beginning
os the writ of n'ovel disseisin in Glanvill.¹
