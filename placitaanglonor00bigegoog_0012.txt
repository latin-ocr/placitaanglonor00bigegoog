The present work is intended to aid the student in
investigating a department of legal history, and not to
teach the history of persons or of general events. Hence
the absence of notes concerning such matters. It is a
book of Law Reports, and edited accordingly; with such

of capitalizing, and to substitute the letter “ v'’ for
the letter “ u’' in such words as “uero’' and “cla-
mauit.'’

It has not been deemed best to add to the expense of
the book by translating the text. The Latinis not

added of such Anglo-Saxon and non-classioal Latin
terme as may need explanation.

writer hopes to give to the printer, in the course of the
