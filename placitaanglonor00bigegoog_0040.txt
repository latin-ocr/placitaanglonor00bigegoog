the Second, upon suggestion of the defendant that a
certain charter of Henry the First had been improperly
obtained, taking the charter int-0 his own hands, turns
to the defendant with the exclamation, “Per oculos Dei,
si cartam hanc salsam comprobare posseS, lucrum mille
librarum mihi in Anglia conferres.” In theease of John,
the Marshall‚ v. Thomas a Becket, p. 211, the same king
angrily calls upon his barons to pronounee judgment
against the defendant. In Archhishop of Canterhury e.
Abbot ol St. Edmund, p. 238, baffled by the productiori
of conflicting title-deeds by the plaintiff and the dc·
landant, the same king says, “I know not what to say,
except that the charters areat suar with each other.’'
And when in the same ease the plaintiff refused to sub-
mit the dispute to the judgment of certain counties, the
king indignantly leaves the court, with the words, “ Iret
him tnke who can.'’

The queen also sat in the courts in person, in thc
absence of the king, if not sometimes when he was
present; as appears by the case of the Men of Periton

absence, were not unfrcquently granted in her name: as
in the case of the Abbot ol St. Augustine's Claim, p. 33,
and iu the case of Bishop Ranulf v. Robert dc Muscams,
p. 137.

'I'he superior courts for the administration of justice
throughout the Norman and sub-Norman period are the
Greot Couneil (corresponding to the Anglo-Saxon
Witenagemot, and still occasionally called by that
name), the King’s Court, and the Enchequer; though
the latter makes no appearanceas a judicial organizati0n
until the reign of Henry Ι. The Great Council eon-
