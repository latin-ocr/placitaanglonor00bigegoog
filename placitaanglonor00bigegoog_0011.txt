in Doomsday as holding land in Sharnburn. Vol. ii.
p. 167. However, the student is now sufficiently put
upon his cantion concerning the case; and alter this,
the editor is quite willing to let the record stand in his
hoolr, as a late account 01 some early case.

The writs 01 Tewksbury Abhey, 2 Monasticon‚ 67-83
(ed. 1846), are 00 example 01 110 01100 class 01 omitted
cases above referred 10. Very few 01 11000, however,
would be of special valne, even if perfect. They are all
fairly represented by other writs here given. Tathis
class belong also cases dismissed with a mere statement
of sentence or judgment pronounoed or executed3 as in
the well-known instance 01 110 hanging of forty-four
thieves by Ralph Basset, referred 10 in the Angla-Saxon
Chronicle, anno 1124.

collection of records 01 litigation only3 the book isin 00
sense intended 00 0 Codex Diplomaticus, and all charters
and documents 001 relating 10 litigation have been
excluded. Many 01 110 extracts from Doomsday 000

presented illustrate some phase 01 110 procedure or suh·
