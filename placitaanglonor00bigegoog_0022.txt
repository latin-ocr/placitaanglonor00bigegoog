Glanvill proceeds to say, with regard to concealment
of treasure trove, that if the party has been convicted‚
presumption making against him, he can still purge
himself by the ordeal. 'Phe convictiou here referred to,
it is proper to observe, isin reality the conviction only

ol a grand jury3 and the ordeal supplies the place os
what, alter the Lateran Conncil oi 1215, anperseded it,-
the trial before a petit jury.²
