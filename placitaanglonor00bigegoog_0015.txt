X INTRODUCTION.

of very many elementa in it, and nota conspicuous

one. It does not lie upon the suriaco: it must be dili·
gently sought out, if its presence would be discovered.
Indeed‚ nearly all that was typical 'os ancient German
law has entirely disappeared. The crdeal, the duel,
compurgation, and wergeldS, have all gone 3 while the
great and essential feature ol the right os self-redrcss
hae so far given way that no statement is more common
in the law-books of to-day than that no one has the
right to talre the law into his own hands.¹ And what
remaine is obscured by the presence of vastly more ex·
tensive elementa. Feudalism‚ distinct from what would
have resulted from the relation of lord and man among
the cinglo-Saxone, the Roman law, commerce, invention,
art, and a thousand potent influences of modern civili-
zation, have added their vast contributione to the English
law, and made it mainly what itis, pushing far into
the background the ancient German clement? The
existing law, whether of contracte, torts, real property,
equity‚ or even of crimes, disconnected from intermediate
stages in history, would fail, in its characteristic parts,
10 reveal “the very form and features ”² of ancient Ger·
man law,—Salic, Saxon, 01 Anglo Saxon. Nor do the
old codes of the German natione contain the “promise
and potency'' os the present common law os England.
What would have been the natural and probable result

¹ A statement, however, 10 be received with some qualification.

²1e is hardly necessary to say that, in speaking of the ancient
German and the present English law, we refer to what is typical
only. The fundamental principles ol' law, or rather of justice, such,
ior example, aa require a man 10 pay his debts and 10 melre compen·
aetion ior hie torte, have, ol course, existed in every stage oi the
history oi the raca.
