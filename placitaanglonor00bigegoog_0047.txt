abbat 3¹ but his holding is by lrnight service, according
to the chroniclc. Rainbaldns is merely stated in Dooms-
day to hold of the ahbot one hide in Tobenie 3² but the
chronicle again states that the tenure is knight service.
Doomsday states that Hubert held in Witham five hides of
thc abbat:³ the chronicle states that he held them by
knight service. And many more cases to the same effect.
Doomsday therefore does not stand in thc way of the
assertion of the wide prevalence of knight service, in
perfect development, in the time of the Conquerar.

The Anglo-Saxon heriot lived on beside the Norman
roliof (relevamen, relevamentum) for a considerable time,
making a saint appearance in Doomsday.⁴ The heriot
was in principle the return at death of the outfit given
aman by hislord when the relationship of lord and man
was assrrmed.⁶ The relief, however, which superseded it
was a payment by the heir to his laad, io knightly

eqnipments, or money,⁶ for the privilege of being in·
vested (raised, relevare) with the estate of his ancestor.
Itis certain that there was for considerable time con·
fusion between the two ideas, as well as io the namcs;
the Angla-Saron term being employed for the Norman

institution.⁷
