England, could it have been left to develope itself upon
¹internal influences alone, wholly apart from contact from
without, it is impossible to say; but it could not bave

teenth century.

It ic true that the external influcnces which have ’

affected the English law have been largely‚ though by
no means wholly, German; but the most potent by far of
all external Germanic influences, the Norman, had itself
been modilied, to a considerable extent,¹ by non-German
or (so to speak) broken-German law. The pure German
law of the cinglo-Saxone received in fact a fatal blow
at the hands of the Normans.

There are plain indications that the law of Normandy
was not wholly free from the influence of the semi-Roman
law and civilization of the South of France. The stimu-

lating influence of the better institutione of the South
bad powerfully affected all the Continental German
natione: primitivo institutione passed by steady trun-
sition into new forma, and new institutione arose by the

side of the old. The Normans in Franco ceased to be
Northmen‚ and became almost as far separated from the
Anglo·Danes as from the Anglo·Saxons; and the
Norman Conquest became the turning-point in the
history of Germanic institutione in England. German
law, now shaken, tottered to its fall.

If, however, instead ol looking for salient features of
German law in the body ol the present law ol England,
we pursue the course of the common law back through
the centuries, we shall be able to discern more and
more of the old Germanic element3 and long before we
reach the Anglo·Saxon period, the origin of the whole
