XXX lnrltout'c‘rlort,

become necessary l'or Parliament to pass a statute to
authorize the grant of writs without imposing upon
suitors the burden (which was practically prohibitiva) of
secking the same through the couucil. 'Phis statute uras
the famous Act of Westmiuster, 2, c. 24, aaran 1285,-
the most salutary and sar reaching euactment ever
passed in the history of English procedure. Under it
arose actions on the case; the clerks iu chancery being
authorized to frame new write wlreuever a meritorious
case was presented “in consimili casu '¹ to any of the
writs already in existence, but for which none of those
writs was adequatc.¹

The necessity for the law authorizing actions on the
case, and the endless traiu of subtleties reaching down to
the present day, which have so often resulted in the per-
versiou of justice, were the natural consequence of de-
priving the king, or rather his chancellor, of the ancient

prerogativa of granting new write. Withiu properlimits,
to guard against ebuso, the right to issue writs when-

evera ease proper for redress or relies was presented iras
salutary, and ita continuance would have saved the·
English law from centurias of constant aud deserved re-
proach. The Statute of Westmiuster 2 was only an at·
tcmpted return to what had existed theoretieally, if not
practicelly,’ uutil the middle of the 13th century‚—to
wit, actions on the case; hut the state of law which

event, the king’a power was abridgcd by legislation, aud not by pre· .
acri tion.

in active force in the greater part of Amerina, as well as in England

an abuse to be corrected.
