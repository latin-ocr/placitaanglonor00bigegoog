law will be manifest from internal evidence. When
. we reach the twelfth century, or even the first half of
ibe thirteenth‚ the English law is manifestly German,
presenting at first almost as strange an appearance, as
compared with the existing law, as does the law of the
Anglo-Saxon codes. But examined more closely, tho
lentunen, dimly outlined, of much that is typical of
modern law appear. 'l'be tenth and the nineteenth cen-
turies are each discernible. This is the transition period,
in which new elementa, blending with the old, give
promise of the later times.

'Phis period of transition begins with the advent of
Norman notions into England and ends with the reign
of Edward the First ς and the first two-thirds of this
period are the time covered by the present work.

The best illustration of the transition state of the
Norman and sub-Norman time is to be found in the
legal procedure of the period. -The typical procedure of
the Anglo·Saxons, the ordeal, is joined by the 'typical
procedure of the Normans, the duel, and lingers on and
finally, in the thirteenth century, dies out¹ beside it;

¹ The edict of the Lateran Council, onae 1215, appears not to have
wholly extinguishcd the ordeal in England. See note, infra, p. xvii.
‘'l'bcre is no mention of trial by battle in any of the Anglo-Saxon
codes; bnt it is scarcely more difficult to account for that fact upon
the supposition that it did exist in England before the Conquest,
than to account for its presumed non-existence. What prevented
its appearance, or caused its early disappearanoe, in England alone?
{irial bycombat certainly did prevail, in the fende among tbe Angla·
Saxona, but whether judicio} combat existed is very doubtful. 'I'be
line between the two is difficolt to draw, especially in the earlier
times, for judicia] combat was only a regulation of the blood-feud,
surronnding it with religione sanctione and ceremonias. In the.
Norae olas-myggvaaonar-Sega, it is said that it was the oustom in
England to settle disputes between two persons by battle. “ llnn
