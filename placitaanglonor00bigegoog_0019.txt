In the time 01 William I., Bishop Remigius, aNorman,
clears himself from a charge os treason by the ordeel 01
fire, undergone by 011001 his household, p. 30. The
ordeal appears again in the case 01 Bishop Gundull o.
Pichot, p. 34. In the case 01 Bishop Wulfstan o. Abbot
Walter, p. 16, the record states that men 01 St. Mary and
01 the bishop were ready to prove by oath and battle the
ease 01 the plaintiff3 and it closes with an 01101 by men
