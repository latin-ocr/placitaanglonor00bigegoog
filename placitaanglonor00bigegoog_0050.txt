Walter o. Gilbert de Baillol, p. 175, the plaintiff is
stated to have aequired the land in dispute from atenant
of Barnhorne with consentes his over-iord Withelard de
Baillol; and in Abbot Hamlin o. Earl William, p. 182,
the archbishop of Canterbury testifies conceming the
grant of a church by Robert de H„ with consent of hie
lord.¹ Indeed the numerous confirmations by over-lords
throughout this period were no doubt sought quite as
much bya prudent sear of the claime of the over-lord
as for protection against the rapacity of others.

Apart from such cases ns the above, lands held in
commendation, of which there are numerous instances in
this boolr,¹ must not bc overlooked in studying the his·
tory of alienation. Doomsday is replete with cases in
which freemen who have commended themselves to others
for protection cannot sell their lands without eonsent.³

And the same nias true in the Anglo-Saxon period.
