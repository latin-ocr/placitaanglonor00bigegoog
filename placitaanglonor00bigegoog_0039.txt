Arehbishop Baldwin, p. alo, the pope's legates are
elotlred with a writ against the defendant from the head
of the Charch; but the record states that the legates
“were in deliberation'’ concerning the manner of exe·
onting the precept.¹

While, however, it is pretty clear that process could
not be excolited against the king in the ordinary course
of justice, it is certain that the king’s rights were osten
brought in question without his consent. Claims were
sometimes set up before the commissionem of Dooms-
day to lands held by the king, and the elaims investigated ;
asin Richard de Surdeval e. The King, p. 51, in Robert,
tlre Dispenser‚ e. 'Phe King, p. 57, and in Iro Tailbois
a. The King, p. 5οἓ And in these cases the claimant
was sometimes successful, as in the last-named case.
But no process appears to have issued against the king;

his interests being attendcd to donbtless by the corn-
missioners. The king iras also frequently vouehed to

warrant his granis.³ But of process issued against tlie
sovereign in the llth and leth centurias tliere is no
evidence*

'Phe king appears in person among the judges in many
of the cases, osten taking an actiae part in the trial. Iu
