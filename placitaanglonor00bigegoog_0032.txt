pendix, taken from Glauvill, indicate, indeed, the work
of a single mind, directed to the attainment of a definite
objeet; but the result is merely the unification and com-
pletion, in proper fullness, of the write at hand.¹

The chief interest attaching to these write arieee from
the fact that in their final, settled form they became the
tixed precedente for the peculias forms of aetion which
have characterized the English law from the time of
Edvvard the Firet to the present day.

It may nothe strictly true that when pleadings eeaeed
to he oral, the established write (or “ write of course ”l
heeame the models upon which the written declaratione
were framed. Douhtlcss for a considerable time the
form of the oral plaint was preserved in memory, and
was merely reduced to writiug hy the plaintiff’s at-
torney3 but the earliest forme of declaration iu existence
show that the plaintiff'e complaint was, as a priori
reasoning would show it must have been, a substantial
repetition of the writ, with such amplification only as
was necessary. It would not be safe, however, to affirm
that in the unsettled, or rather transition, period of

process we have in the writs any certain indication of a

write of Henry 11. may not have existed in the same form lor a short

time previously in Normandy. The point is, that there is no gap in 0

England in the history of the writ. The form temp. llenry ΙΙ. follows
naturally upon the previous write, end requires no suggestion os an
importation to account for it. It may be added, however, that
Brunner’s argument in favour os Normnndy is not very well eup-
ported. Schwnrgerichte‚ 295, eol-303. The evidence risos little
above conjecture. Moreover, the write from Normuudy to whioh he
refers are quite different in form from those above given, and aro not
in the regular order of development from the write ol lIenry 1. Nona
of the English recognition write contain the expression ¹⁶ seeundum
assisam meam ’¹ used in Normundy. The expression in Glanvill
‘¹ posuit ee inde in assisam meam,¹' lib. 2, c. 8, refers to the Grand
Assius, which is attributed to Henry II.
