advent of the Normans, it became necessary to call for a
force of soldiery to protect the possessione of the estab-
lishment. At first the abhot (Adelelm) employed
stipendiariam but aster the disturbanees had been quelled,
and after the great surrey had determined the number
of men that might be required os the abbey for military
service, these stipendiarias were retained and turned into
tenants by knight service, vacant landa being assigned
to them upon the undertaking of the tenanta to answer,
when called upon, sor each one’s portion ¹

Similar circumstances existing in other places, it is
fair to presume that this is not a solitary instance.
Wherever the rich possessions of the chnrch or laity
were exposed to the depredations of lawless hands, the
protection of the military would naturally bc sought3
and if faithful service was rendered, the soldiers would
bc permitted to become tenants of any vacant lands

when their services were no longer needed as soldiers.

But the case does not rest upon presurnption. It appears
hy Elton's 'Penures of Kent² that the king turned his
dreng tenants³ into knights for tho defenee of the
country, and that archbishop Lanfranc did likewise.⁴
