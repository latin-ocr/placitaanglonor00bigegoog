Howevcr, the record of Doomsday has been thought
to be a check upon any generalizations founded upon
the state of things existing before the survey.¹ There
are numerous references to “milites'’ in Doomsday3
but the term is ‚very rarely used as descriptiva of tenure.
Of over a hundred passages carefully examined‚ in which
“ milites ’³ are said to hold lands‚ there are but two
passages in which there is any clear indication that the
tenure was knight service.² And the first of these may
only mean that the land was to furnish a soldier. Tho
other passage, however, is clear. This fact would seem
at first conclusive that knight service was extremely
rare and exceptional3 but the truth is, Doomsday does
not always disclose the tenure by which the holders of
land were possessed. And the lands of Abingdon furnish
conclusive evidence on this point. The Doomsday record,
for example, simply declares that “ Gilbert holds of the
abbot seren hides and a half in Garsington ;”³ hut tho
Abingdon Chronicle states that Gilbert held this par·
tieular land by knight service.⁴ 'Phe same person is
referred to again directly afterwards as holding in

Sueting a hide and a half of thc ahbot, without mention
of the service3 but the chronicle says that he held this
also by knight service.⁵ Anshill who appears as de-
fendant in a case already referred to,⁶ is mentioned in
Doomsday as holding a hide of land in Marcham of the
