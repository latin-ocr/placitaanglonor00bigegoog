Matilda, pp. 79, 82, and perhaps in the reign of Henry
11, as in the case of Robert de lelcsham e. Abbot Walter,
p. 179. This last case, however, was an offer of proof
by persons who might have been called as witnesses.
'Phe use of chartam, however, continued to be a more
general, as it was a more satisfactory, form of proof.
Charters appear, to have always hoen employed to the
exclusion of the other modes of procl, excepting by
witnesses,¹ when litigante were so fortunate as to own
tlrem; at all events there is no indication, in any of the
numerous cases, of the use of wager of law, or of the
ordeal, οι· duel, when a charter was introduced in evi-
denee‚² except when there was doubt as to the genuine·
ness of the charter.³ And even thenis the judges
found the question ol its genuineness difficolt to decide
they sometimes suggested a compromise; as in Abbot
of Battel v. Alan, p. 245. In ease the charter were
rejected as a forgery, the party who offered it would ol
course fail, unless he evas allowed to fall back upon the
ordeal or the duel. However, it must be remembcred
that upon judgment in any ease, not compromised or
confessed, the defeated party could sammon the judges
to the duel lor false judgment.⁴ In the ease of Robert
Fardenc, Appendix C, p. 306, that person offers to prove

¹ “Per cartas suaset per testes suos.’' P. 27.

¹ 'l’he expression “justo Dei judiei0” in theonae ol Bishop Wulstan
v. Arohbiehop Thomas, p. 3, where charters were produced, is pro.
bably not used in any technieal sonsa. The phrase is often need hy
the chroniclers where it could not mean the ordeal or the duel. See,
for example, Rog. de Hor. anno 1135; l Twysdon'e Son‘pt. 614. But
is the ordea] was used in Wulstan o. Thomas, it was probably because
thecharters were nearly worn out,—“ scriptis evidentissimis detritis,
et penitus annihilatis.’'
