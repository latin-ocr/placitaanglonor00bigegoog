stated to hare been present at the earlier trial-a singular 1301 11
Mr. 1·“ reeman's view be correct, since they would be the very persons
to bear witness of the concord. Most 11 not all 01 them held lands
in worcestershire 31 the time of the surrey.l llence, probably,
they could not bare lired far away, and might well be expected to
be present throughout. Besides, Heming also gives (p. 291) the
names 01 110030 31 Oewaldslaw wbo errore on behalf of the 10131000
and prior before the commissionem, either 31 the second trial, or,
more likely, in making the Doomsday return 01 the property 01
the churcb; and not one of the persons present 31 the first trial
appears among them.

The difficulties are 311 removed by supposing 3 considerable
nterral between the two trials. When the cause came before the
commissione, the witnesses who appeared before bishop Gcoffrey
mny well hare been absent from the county‚ or 00331110 11 may
bave been forgotten who they were. It seems, then, not unreason-
able to assign tbe first trial to the early 030101 11ιο administration
01 Walter (who was induoted ebbot in hlny. 1077), when the dis-
0010 probably arose² The bisbop would hardly be content 10
allow the abbot to hold the property 00300301] 100 eight or nine
years, and thus 10 gradually fortify himself by epreson'ptire title.

This rien also makes the record 01 bishop Geotfrey more intelli·
gible. It was sent to the oourt in the ordinary way, 33 evidence
concerning 3 decision rendered a considerable time since, the exist·
00000 00 nature 01 which, aller surh an interval, might be seriously
disputed; 100· 111310 be remembered 1131311131 time jndgmeuts
were not regularly enrolled and preserved by the conrts. Other

11 should be added that Palgrare and the editor 01 1100 1133300 in

AngloSoxon Law 3130 nesign the 0103 before bishop Geotfrey 10
“about 1077.” ¹
