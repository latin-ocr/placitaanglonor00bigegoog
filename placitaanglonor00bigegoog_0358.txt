ΜΓ. Treeman assigns the whole litigation‚ including thc plca given
ante, pp. 16-19, tc thc time ol the surrey, asserting that the
king’s writ (supra) ‘⁴ vvas scut to tha commissionem sor the very
purpose os fixing the cntry to bc made in Doomsday.” 5 Norman
Conqnml, 763 (Orsord cd). But there are strong grounds for
doubting this statement.

Itis perfectly clear from the various records hers given that there
were two stages to this litigation, or rather two distinct litigatione ;
the first, as bishop Geoffrey's writ states, being the trial before him
and his associatos, and the second, as the acknovvledgment of the
concord shows, being before the commissionem of Doomsday. Now
it may well bc inquired why, il the commissionem ordered the trial
reported ante, p. 16, they should not have been satisfied with tho
return made by thc presiding judgc, without an acknowledgment,
belorc themselves, ol the concord just agreed upon, according totlris
view, in open court. The proceeding would be idle, unless it was
in the nature ol aa sppcal lrom thc judgment pronounced by Geof·
srey3 and nothing ol this kind appeam.

There are, however, stronger grounds for suppcsing that the
trial reported near the commencement ol this bools was distinct
srom the aclvncwledgment of the concord, antedsting it bya con·
sidemble number of years. The procedure there employed is the
old procedure of the Anglo-Saxons (which lingered on for a very
long period aster the Conquest). The record is clear upon this
point: it shows the case divided in the midst hy a judgment in
the usual Angla-Saron manner, not upon the meritc of the cause,
but directing the medeci producing the procis. Ante, p. 18,
‘⁴ Tandem er precepto‚” dic. Sec also Essays in AngloSaxon Law,
p. ⁸249, to the same effect. And it is worthy os notice that the
king’s writ does not order an inquisition, but is substantially what
in later times was called a writ of right-s vvrit as yet imperiectly
developed. The litigetion before thc commissionem ol Doomsday,
anthe other hand, was under the new procedure by inquisition, as
is distinctly stated in the passage last quoted from Heming. For
such a purpose, the hing's writ should have been lilre the vvrits
given ante, pp. 24, 33.

If it should still be said that this does not show that the two

trials might not huve been continuasset nearly so, there remains
another potent fact. The names of those present at the later
